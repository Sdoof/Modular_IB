# Modular_Blank
Modular IB_Insync strategy -- 
This is mean't to be used as a base framework to automate trading of multiple instruments in Python with Interactive Brokers.  
Simply fill in entry logic, add indicators or filters to the DF's, and select an interval -- and hit run.

Issue -- If logging does not work in spyder output, comment out the if statement in log function.

Best of luck!
